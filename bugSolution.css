The solution involves correcting the syntax and using appropriate spacing within the `calc()` function:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20px); /* Corrected spacing */
}

.anotherElement {
  height: calc(100% - 50px); /*Correct use of subtraction with different units*/
}
```

To avoid mixing data types, always ensure you're performing calculations on numbers with compatible units.  Avoid adding strings directly into a numerical `calc()` expression.
