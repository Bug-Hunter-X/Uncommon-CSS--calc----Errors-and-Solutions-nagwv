The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if there is a syntax error within the `calc()` expression, it can cause unexpected behavior or render nothing.  For example, using incorrect spacing or missing operators can lead to unexpected outcomes. Consider the following example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20px ); /* Incorrect spacing*/
}
```
This will likely result in an error because of the space between `20px` and the closing parenthesis `)`.  The correct form is:
```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 20px);
}
```
Another common mistake is mismatching units or mixing different data types, such as trying to add a string to a number: 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + "20px"); /*Mixing data type*/
}
```
